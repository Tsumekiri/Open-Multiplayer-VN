# Open Multiplayer VN

This is an on-going refactor of my [previous version](https://gitlab.com/Yohaulticetl/open-multiplayer-vn). It changes the code to be more modular, comprehensible and maintainable. Once that is done, focus will be set to making better server administration tools.

It's made in the Godot engine.

Current font: [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto), change the theme in the Resources folder if you wish to set another main font.
